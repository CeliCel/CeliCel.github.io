			<p>I'm a full time CS major taking courses from JS/jQuery to Data Structures. 
				Part time, I’m an instructor at The Coder School. Currently, as a Code Coach, I’m responsible for creating 
				and assigning material for each student depending on their experience level, age and programming language preference. 
				You can see the final projects in the, ‘The Coder School’ repository. I’m currently taking classes in Javascript/ jQuery, 
				Mobile Web App Dev and LINUX/UNIX machines, check my repository for this semesters projects in their respective repository. 
				I’m currently in a position to gain experience through projects and/or help desk IT service positions. 
				I work great with a team when there is a common goal and I’m a self-starter for tasks assigned for myself. 
				My passions include educating and motivating others to pursue IT, programming and engineering fields as an ambassador 
				for TECHNOLOchicas and member of the Society of Hispanic Engineers</p>
